# Security Considerations for ECS Fargate Cluster Module

This document outlines security considerations and recommendations when using this ECS Fargate Cluster module.

## Checkov Analysis Results

A security scan with Checkov identified the following area for improvement:

### Critical Finding

1. **Container Insights**
   - Finding: Container Insights should be enabled on the ECS cluster
   - Recommendation: Enable CloudWatch Container Insights for better monitoring
   - Implementation: This module enables Container Insights by default through the `enable_container_insights` variable

## Implementation Notes

Here are some best practices when using this ECS cluster module:

1. **Monitoring**: 
   - Keep Container Insights enabled (default setting) to ensure proper monitoring of cluster resources
   - Consider setting up CloudWatch alarms for key ECS metrics

2. **Access Management**:
   - Use IAM roles with the principle of least privilege when interacting with the ECS cluster
   - Implement resource-based policies for the ECS cluster when needed

3. **Encryption**:
   - When deploying tasks to this cluster, ensure sensitive data is encrypted
   - Use AWS KMS for encryption keys

4. **Networking Recommendations**:
   - Deploy tasks to private subnets when possible
   - Use security groups with minimal required access

## Optional Security Enhancements

In your broader infrastructure, consider implementing:

```hcl
# Example VPC Flow Logging for the VPC where ECS tasks will run
resource "aws_flow_log" "vpc_flow_log" {
  log_destination      = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.flow_log.arn
  log_destination_type = "cloud-watch-logs"
  traffic_type         = "ALL"
  vpc_id               = aws_vpc.main.id
}
```
